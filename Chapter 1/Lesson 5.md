# Tokens

###### tags: `Chapter 1`

This lesson highlights key aspects of the TON platform that enable the creation of custom assets referred to as tokens. These tokens encompass a wide range of valuable entities that can be transferred and transformed, expanding beyond mere currencies to encompass a variety of assets. Tokens collectively encompass everything of value and can be thought of as *tokenization*, dividing value into transferable units.

**Fungible vs Non-Fungible Tokens**
Tokens come in two primary categories: **fungible** and **non-fungible** (NFTs). Non-fungible tokens are unique, possessing an owner but not divisible into interchangeable parts. They encompass collectibles like tickets, TON DNS records, usernames, financial contracts, and subscription system objects. Unique tokens grant ownership transfer, key rotation, and business sale capabilities.

Fungible tokens, on the other hand, have a quantity alongside ownership. Common examples include stable coins, cryptocurrencies, and in-game currency. These tokens have a scalable structure, with each owner's balance held in their individual contract. Transfer messages update balances across contracts, avoiding direct ownership switch.

**Scalability of Tokens in TON**
Both non-fungible and fungible tokens are scalable within the TON ecosystem. Scalability is integral to TON's design, enabling transactions without bottlenecks. Introducing auxiliary tokens further enhances scalability. These tokens represent different states of funds, such as temporarily unavailable balances. Users perceive these auxiliary tokens as varying states of their primary assets, maintaining a seamless experience.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, tokens are a fundamental aspect of the TON platform. They offer the capability to create custom assets, both fungible and non-fungible, that hold value beyond mere currency. Tokens act as building blocks for more intricate functionalities, underpinning the design of applications within the TON ecosystem.
