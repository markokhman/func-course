# The overview of the TON ecosystem

###### tags: `Chapter 1`

In this chapter will talk about the overall architecture, the design principles, and the important parts that build up the TON platform.


## What is TON?

TON is a platform for decentralized applications, encompassing users, validators, and app developers. It's more than just a blockchain. 
###### In TON there are different parties:
- users who hold assets that are existing on TON
- validators who operate the core consensus 
- app developers who provide all the services

## Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Services

###### There are different categories of apps and services:
- Custodial 
- Non-custodial

>  **Custodial services** – services that are operated by the party that bears responsibility for deposited funds.

*Online exchanges are typically custodial services because they need to take the coins or tokens on the balance of their own wallets to guarantee settlement of trades.*

> :exclamation: Online exchanges create risks because exchanges could be hacked and their funds could be stolen and impossible to recover.

> **Non-custodial services** – services that do not hold user’s funds and users have direct personal control over the funds.

> :exclamation: Such services keep all the assets in the hands of the user, so it becomes harder to hack the system.



## Centralized vs. Decentralized Apps

##### Applications can be:
- Centralized
- Decentralized 


> :sparkles: A centralized app is the app that effectively has a server, while a decentralized app doesn't require a server, it runs directly on a blockchain smart contract. 


## Entities built on blockchain

There are different categories of entities that you can build using smart contracts on a blockchain.

Smart contracts drive various entities:
-  DEXs
- Tokens
    - currencies
    - collectibles
    - utility tokens
- Auctions
- Domain names


## Conclusion 
The TON ecosystem comprises *wallets, exchanges, traders, and consumers* interacting through smart contracts. The course delves into authorized *smart contracts, TON connect, building auxiliary features, and communication between decentralized and centralized apps*.
