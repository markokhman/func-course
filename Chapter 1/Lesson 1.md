# The overview of the TON ecosystem

###### tags: `Chapter 1`

In this section the TON ecosystem's architecture is explored.


## What is TON?

TON is a platform for decentralized applications, encompassing users, validators, and app developers. It's more than just a blockchain.

## Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Services

Custodial services hold users' funds, posing risks if hacked. Non-custodial services give users control over assets,  using secure smart contracts.


## Centralized vs. Decentralized Apps

Centralized apps have servers, while decentralized apps use blockchain's smart contracts. Decentralized apps, like decentralized exchanges, rely on blockchain execution instead of private servers.


## Entities Built on Blockchain

Smart contracts drive various entities, including DEXs, tokens, auctions, and domain names. Tokens have diverse forms, including currencies, collectibles, and utility tokens.


## Smart Contracts in the Ecosystem 

Smart contracts serve as utilities within complex systems. Central contracts manage data, while satellite contracts handle user-specific features.


## Conclusion 
The TON ecosystem comprises wallets, exchanges, traders, and consumers interacting through smart contracts. The course delves into authorized smart contracts, TON connect, building auxiliary features, and communication between decentralized and centralized apps.
