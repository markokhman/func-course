# Blockchain design principle and three generations of blockchains

###### tags: `Chapter 1`

This lesson explores the historical evolution of blockchain design, focusing on three generations of blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TON.

## Bitcoin Blockchain

Bitcoin was the first blockchain, designed to address censorship-resistant digital cash transfers. It utilized a ledger with accounts identified by public keys, allowing the transfer of coins between accounts. Transactions were authorized using cryptographic signatures. Bitcoin's structure included multi-input/output transactions and chain consensus, maintained by proof of work. A scripting language extension enabled complex control over transactions, though limited in scope. Bitcoin's privacy measures included generating new account addresses for transfers.

## Ethereum Blockchain

Ethereum, a second-generation blockchain, broadened the scope by introducing composable contracts and a flexible account structure. It allowed users to execute arbitrary functions on the blockchain by paying for execution costs. This flexibility enabled decentralized finance applications. However, Ethereum's richness in functionality posed scalability challenges due to the architecture's limitations.

## TON Blockchain

TON, a third-generation blockchain, introduced limitations to achieve scalability. Contracts on TON had localized visibility and communicated through messages, unlocking scalability potential. Proof-of-Stake replaced Proof-of-Work for consensus, allowing separate validator groups and efficient message routing. TON implemented precise cost controls, requiring payments for execution, data storage, and message routing, ensuring scalability and mitigating denial-of-service risks.

## Conclusion

In summary, the evolution of blockchains progressed from Bitcoin's simple yet impactful design to Ethereum's enhanced functionality, which encountered scalability limitations. TON, as a third-generation blockchain, addressed these limitations through innovative constraints, scalable features, and meticulous cost controls. This novel approach paved the way for infinite scaling possibilities while ensuring security and efficiency in blockchain operations.
